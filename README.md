# Real Time Data COVID-19


This application is for viewing COVID-19 data in real time and fast because it is made statically.

## Template

The template I use is [Elisyam](https://themeforest.net/item/elisyam-web-app-admin-dashboard-template/21917353).

## Several additional libraries

* [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) - The web framework used
* [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) - HTTP Client
* [Highchart](https://www.highcharts.com/) - Chart that I use
* [Papaparse](https://www.papaparse.com/) - Parsing CSV Data

## Data Sources
* [COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)
